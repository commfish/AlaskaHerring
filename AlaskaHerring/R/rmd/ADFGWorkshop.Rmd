# Overview

## Objective
The overarching objective of this 3-day workshop is to introduce the proposed changes I'm recommending for the Sitka Herring ASA model and to discuss how it can be used and modified for other Alaska herring stocks. In its current form, the ASA model uses a weighted least squares approach for parameter estimation and quantifying uncertainty. I'm proposing changes that would bring the ASA model into a more modern statistical realm, where data weighting issues and additional structural assumptions can be explored jointly. Uncertainty in short-term forecasts are easily quantified and integrated into a decision making framework for managers. The proposed changes can accommodate both Bayesian and maximum likelihood estimation.

# Day 1


## General Introduction 

Statistical Catch Age (SCA) models are now widely used in fisheries stock assessment.  

The priciple difference between a Stastical Catch Age Model and Virtual Population Analysis (VPA) are how errors are propogated through time, and the assumptions about the data.

A statistical catch-at-age model is written as:
\[ N_{i,j} = N_{i-1,j-1} \exp(-Z_{i-1,j-1}) \] 
and we read this as the numbers-at-age $j$ in year $i$ are equal to last years numbers-at-age $j-1$ that survive at a rate $Z_{i,j}$.

Contrast with a VPA, which is written as:
\[ N_{i-1,j-1}  = \frac{N_{i,j} }{ \exp(-Z_{i-1,j-1})} \]

In this case the model is propagating the numbers-at-age backwards in time. The primary difference in error propagation between VPA and SCA is that VPA inflates errors in the estimates of recruitment; whereas in the SCA, errors dimish over time at at rate of $Z_{i,j}$.  Neither approach is write or wrong; there is a large literature on this subject.  The main issue at heart is the assumptions about the age composition data.  The VPA assumes catch is known without error.  The SCA does not make this same assumption, but the error distribution is conditional on other model assumptions. 

I've had great experience with SCA's in terms of creating flexible modeling enviroments that are good for integrating many different data types. My experience with VPAs in this regard has not been so great.


### A biologist view.

From a biologist perspective, the population dynamics is the focal point of the stock assessment.  Key demographic variables of interest are: growth, maturity, fecundity, natural mortality.  Model assumptions are generally structrual (e.g., age-dependent or age-independent natural mortality rates).

### A statistician/biometrician view.

A Statistician worries more about sampling design, and how do the observed state variables (i.e., mile days of milt) relate to the unobserved state variables (i.e., spawning stock biomass). Are the logistics feasible for collecting random samples?

Are these indicies proportional to the unobserved states?  This is a difficult question to test experimentally, so simplifying assumptions are often necessary.

What is the error distribution surrounding the observation errors?  Are the age-composition samples sampled from a true multinomial distribution?  If so what is the effective sample size relative to other data that are being jointly considered?

"Stock assessment scientist boldly go where whimpy statisticians fear to tred."  Ransom A. Meyers (RAM), 2002.

"Statitisticians tend to focus on statistical performance (i.e., how well does the model fit the data), but they largely ignore policy performance."

### A manager/decision maker's view.
"Fisheries management is about making choices among alternative policy options." 
Walters and Martell, 2004

> Managers Role: **Risk Management**

	**Objective:** is to assure uncertainty does not deflect the endeavor from the goals and objectives of the Fisheries Management Plan.

> Analyst Role:  **Risk Assessment**

	**Objective:** is to quantify the uncertainty associated with alternative harvest policies.

Good communication between Manager and Analyst is vital.  

#### Both manager and analyst should have a clear understanding in the following areas:

* Key Policy variables
	+ reference points, 
	+ stock status, 
	+ trends in stock status,
	+ trends in fishing mortality rates,
	+ performance targets.

* Maintaining opportunities to fish.
* Consquences of each alternative policy option â€“- requires the ability to make predictions.


## Technical differences
### Similarities: Herring Vs. Groundfish

All of these age-structured assessment model are modified versions of a simple depletion estimator.

In the simplest case are only 2 key features are required: a history of removals, and an index of abundance.  You cannot have one or the other for a depeltion estimator. So if there is no fishery that has the potential to create contrast in the abundance index, then you must opt for an alternative approach (e.g., mark-recapture, or absolute estimates).

## Differences: Herring Vs. Groundfish

* Pulse versus continuous fisheries.
	+ Catch equations differ.
	+ Modification to the population dynamics.

* Data types 
	+ absolute vs relative indices.
	+ sampling programs.
* Model Structure
	+ Conditioned on catch: catch is directly removed, and assumed no errors in the reported catch.
	+ Conditioned on effort: a vector of fishing mortality rates are estimated and the model is fit to catch.  Allows for errors in the reported catch to be integrated into the model.
* Largely a terminal fishery harvesting only mature fish.
	+ Groundfish: more year around operation with both fishing and natural mortality occuring simutaneously.
	+ Herring: is more of a pulse fishery.
	+ Unique fisheries for roe: impact future recruitment.
* Any many other minor differences ...

## Benefits of a new SCA
* What information is available in composition data.
	+ Age-comp data can potentially inform about:
		+ age-at-recruitment to the fishery, 
		+ total mortality based on catch curves, 
		+ the relative abundance of each cohort, 
		+ and how total mortality can be partitioned into components of F and M.
* Can easily explore, or integrate over, structural uncertainty.
	+ Alternative assumptions about error distributions for age-comps.
	+ Alternative structural assumptions about Stock-recruitment, or natural mortality.
* Less subjectivity associated with data-weighting.
* Better represent uncertainty in forecasts under an integrated framework.
* AD Model Builder has many statistical features for constructing joint posterior distributions; critical for decision analysis.
